\caption{Systems providing timed code at sub-process granularity}
\label{tab:related}
\end{table*}

A number of past projects (Table~\ref{tab:related}) have sought to provide
bounded-time execution of chunks of code at sub-process granularity.
For the purpose of our discussion, we
refer to a portion of the program whose execution should be bounded as \textbf{timed
code} (a generalization of a preemptible function); exactly what form this takes
depends on the system's interface.

Interface notwithstanding, the systems' most distinguishing
characteristic is the mechanism by which they enforce execution bounds.  At one end
of the spectrum are \textbf{cooperative} multitasking systems where
timed code voluntarily cedes the CPU to another
task via a runtime check.  (This is often done implicitly; a simple example is a
compiler that injects a conditional branch
at the beginning of any function call from timed code.)
Occupying the other extreme are \textbf{preemptive} systems that externally
pause timed code and transfer control to a scheduler routine (e.g., via
an interrupt service routine or signal handler, possibly within the language's VM).

\dga{May want to cut long-running CPU instructions unless we can come up with a
modern (i.e., non-VAX) example.  Furthermore, it invites disagreement.}

The cooperative approach tends to be unable to interrupt two classes of timed code:\@
(1) \textbf{blocking-call} code sections that cause
long-running kernel traps (e.g., by making I/O system calls),
thereby preventing the interruption logic from being run; and (2)
\textbf{excessively-tight loops} whose body does not contain any yield points (e.g.,
spin locks or long-running CPU instructions).
Although some cooperative systems refine their approach with mechanisms
to tolerate either blocking-call code sections~\cite{www-golang} or excessively-tight
loops~\cite{vanderwaart:cmucs2006}, we're not aware of any that are capable of
handling both
cases.

One early instance of timed code support was the \textit{engines} feature of
the Scheme 84 language~\cite{haynes:iucs1984}.  This added a new \texttt{engine}
keyword that behaved similarly to \texttt{lambda}, but created a special ``thunk''
accepting as an argument the number of ticks (abstract time units) it should run for.
The caller also supplied a callback function to receive the
timed code's return value upon successful completion.  Like the rest of the
Scheme language, engines were stateless:\@ whenever one ran out of computation time,
it would return a replacement engine recording the point of interruption.  Engines'
implementation relied heavily on Scheme's managed runtime, with ticks
corresponding to virtual machine instructions and cleanup handled by the garbage
collector.  Although the literature suggests using timer interrupts as an
alternative, this was apparently never tried.

\dga{In the early days of green threading, runtimes (e.g., libasync) would use
complex and fragile handling of blocking calls, proxying them to \texttt{select()}
or similar.  Might be a good footnote to pacify the old, crotchety reviewer.}

In 2006, C.\@ Joseph Vanderwaart introduced a language, \textit{Lilt}, for writing
programs with statically-enforced timing policies~\cite{vanderwaart:cmucs2006}.
Its compiler tracks the possible duration of each path through a program and
inserts yield operations wherever a timeout could possibly occur.  Although this
approach requires assigning the execution limit at compile time, the compiler is able
to handle excessively-tight loops by instrumenting backward jumps.
Blocking-call functions remained a challenge, however:\@ handling them would have
required
operating system support, reminiscent of \textit{Singularity}'s static language-based
isolation~\cite{hunt:msr2005}.

Some recent languages offer explicit userland threading, which could be used to
support timed
code.  One example is the Go language's~\cite{www-golang} \textit{goroutines}.
The language's runtime includes a cooperative scheduler that conditionally yields
at function call sites.  This has long caused problems with tight loops, with the
traditional workaround being to manually add calls to the \texttt{runtime.Gosched()}
yield function~\cite{www-golang-tightloop}.

The solutions described thus far all assume languages with a heavyweight,
garbage-collected runtime.  However, some recent systems seek
to support timed code with fewer
dependencies.  One example is the userland C-language thread library for realtime
systems (here, ``\textit{RT}'') developed by Mollison and
Anderson~\cite{mollison:rtas2013}, which performs
preemption using timer interrupts, as proposed in the early Scheme engines
literature.  They install a periodic signal handler responsible for scheduling
tasks and migrating them between cores.  This lightweight runtime
achieves average overall scheduling latencies in the tens of microseconds;
however, we'll soon see that this comes with poor developer usability.

\textit{Shinjuku}~\cite{Kaffes:nsdi2019} is an operating system designed to perform
preemption at microsecond scale.  Built on the Dune framework~\cite{Belay:osdi2012},
it runs tasks on a pool of worker threads controlled by a single centralized
dispatcher thread.  The latter polices how long each task has been running and
sends an inter-processor interrupt (IPI) to any worker whose task has timed out.
The authors study the cost of IPIs and the overheads
imposed by performing them within a VT-x virtual machine, as required by Dune.  They
then implement optimizations to reduce these overheads at the expense of Shinjuku's
isolation from the rest of the system.

As seen in in Section~\ref{sec:intro}, nonreentrant interfaces are fundamentally
incompatible with externally-imposed time limits.  Because such interfaces are
prolific in popular dependencies, state-of-the-art solutions do not permit timed code
to call into third-party libraries.  Scheme engines and
Lilt skirt this issue by only supporting functional code, which cannot have shared
state.  Due to its focus on realtime embedded systems, RT assumes
that the timed code in its threads will avoid shared state; this mostly precludes
calls to third-party libraries, though the system supports the dynamic memory
allocator by treating it as specifically nonpreemptible.  Rather than dealing with
shared state itself, Shinjuku asks application authors to annotate any code with
potential concurrency concerns using a nonpreemptible \texttt{call\_safe()} wrapper.
And although Go is able to preempt goroutines written in the language
itself, a
goroutine that makes any foreign calls to other languages is treated as
nonpreemptible by the runtime's scheduler~\cite{www-golang-fficall}.
