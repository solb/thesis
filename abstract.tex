Modern cloud computing environments strive to
provide users with:\ fine-grained
scheduling and accounting, and seamless scalability.
The most recent face to this trend is the ``serverless''
model, in which individual functions, or microservices,
are executed on demand.  Although implementations
of this model are already becoming popular, current ones
operate at a relatively coarse granularity, occupying
resources for minutes at a time and requiring hundreds
of milliseconds for a cold launch.
In this paper, we describe a novel design for
providing ``functions as a service'' (FaaS) that attempts
to be truly \emph{micro}:\ cold launch times in microseconds
enable even finer-grained resource accounting, and
support latency-critical applications. To accomplish this,
we propose eschewing much of the traditional serverless
infrastructure in favor of language-based isolation that
can provide microsecond-granularity launch latency, and
microsecond-scale preemptive scheduling using high-precision timers.
