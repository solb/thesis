\begin{abstract}

Lamenting the lack of a natural userland abstraction for preemptive interruption and
asynchronous cancellation, we propose lightweight preemptible functions, a mechanism
for synchronously performing a function call with a precise timeout
that is lightweight, efficient, and composable, all while being portable
between programming languages.  We present the design of \textit{libinger}, the
library that provides this abstraction, on top of which we build
\textit{libturquoise}, arguably the first general-purpose and backwards-compatible
preemptive thread library
implemented entirely in userland.  Finally, we demonstrate the applicability to and
performance of this software stack on the problems of combatting head-of-line
blocking and time-based DoS attacks on existing systems.
