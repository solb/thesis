This chapter provides a case study of how lightweight preemptible functions could be
used to create the serverless platform of the future.  We have not prototyped any of
its ideas on \textit{libinger}; rather, they formed the initial motivation for
fine-grained preemption and the inspiration for the preemptible function abstraction.

Section~\ref{sec:libinger:quantum} demonstrates that interval timers are capable of
delivering signals with this frequency.

Given our performance goals, there is a crucial isolation aspect that Rust does not
provide:\@ there is nothing to stop users from monopolizing the CPU.  Our system,
however, must be preemptive.  We can apply preemptible functions
(Chapter~\ref{chap:functions}) here to impose a time quota on each microservice.
This has the added benefit of automatically providing memory isolation between
library dependencies (Chapter~\ref{chap:libgotcha}), insulating unsafe platform code
from affecting the state of other microservices or the rest of the worker process.
