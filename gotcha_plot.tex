Functions' addresses are replaced by the address of a special function,
\texttt{procedure\_linkage\_override()}.  Whenever the program tries to call one of
the affected functions, this intermediary checks the thread's next libset, looks up
the address of the appropriate definition in the shadow GOT, and jumps to it.
Because \texttt{procedure\_linkage\_override()} runs between the caller's
\texttt{call} instruction and the real function, it is written in assembly to avoid
clobbering registers.
