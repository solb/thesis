Some recent languages offer explicit userland threading, which could be used to
support timed
code.  One example is the Go language's~\cite{www-golang} \textit{goroutines}.
Its runtime includes a cooperative scheduler that conditionally yields
at function call sites.  This causes problems with tight loops, which require the
programmer to manually add calls to the \texttt{runtime.Gosched()}
yield function~\cite{www-golang-tightloop}.
