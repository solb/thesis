Fortunately, we find that high-precision event timers (HPETs) on modern CPUs
are sufficient for this task. We measure the granularity and reliability of
these timers as follows: We install a signal handler and configure a POSIX timer to
trigger it every $T$~\textmu{}s.
Ideally, this handler would always be called exactly $T$~\textmu{}s after its last
invocation; we measure the deviation from $T$ over 65,535 iterations.
We find that the variance
is smaller than 0.5~\textmu{}s for $T \ge 3$~\textmu{}s. This shows that
intra-process preemption is fast and reliable enough for our needs.
