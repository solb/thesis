\section*{Appendix}

The reader may be inclined to ask, ``Isn't this just...''

\paragraph{Active Networks?}  No:  A key challenge in active networks (the
``capsule,'' or code-carrying-packet view) was resource management in a
global network.  Our scenario is simpler:  It lacks the hard realtime
constraints of active networks, and the customers of an FaaS service are
\emph{paying customers} to whom resource use can trivially be billed.

\paragraph{Java (etc.)-based OSes?}  No:  Our goal is not to provide
extensibility of the OS (as in SPIN~\cite{Bershad+:sosp15}), or to allow unencumbered
access to OS facilities (as in JANOS~\cite{Tullmann2002}).  Indeed, we are quite happy
imposing very tight constraints on the services and resources that
can be accessed by by a Function, and the requirement for ``approximate
statelessness'' that FaaS services impose makes this imposition tractable.
