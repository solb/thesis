\subsection{Isn't This Just...}

\textbf{Active Networks?}  No:  A key challenge in active networks (the
``capsule'', or code-carrying-packet view) was resource management in a
global network.  Our scenario is simpler:  It lacks the hard realtime
constraints of active networks, and the customers of an FaaS service are
\emph{paying customers} to whom resource use can trivially be billed.

\textbf{Java (etc.)-based OSes?}  No:  Our goal is not to provide
extensibility of the OS (as in SPIN), or to allow unencumbered
access to OS facilities (as in JANOS).  Indeed, we are quite happy
imposing very tight constraints on the services and resources that
can be accessed by by a Function, and the requirement for ``approximate
statelessness'' that FaaS services impose makes this imposition tractable.
