\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:eval}

We now evaluate preemptible function performance, presenting several
microbenchmarks and two examples of their application to improve
existing systems' resilience to malicious or otherwise long-running
requests.

\solb{Should we mark every test we run without global variable interposition?}


\subsection{Microbenchmarks}

\subsection{Web server}

\subsection{Image decompression}

The Web benchmark showed preemptive scheduling at scale, but did not exercise
preemptible function cancellation.
\input{eval_cancel}
The
results for \texttt{fork()} represent a best-case scenario for that technique, as we
did not implement a shared memory mechanism for sharing the buffer, and the cost of
the system call will increase with the number pages mapped by the process (which was
small in this case).
