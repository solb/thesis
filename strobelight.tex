\solb{Last summer, we had a first-year undergraduate student use \textit{libinger} to
build a preemptive RPC server where requests are transparently served using
preemptible functions so the developer does not have to manually check for timeouts.
What's more, the system caches paused preemptible functions and uses them to
partially ``memoize'' repeated requests for unfinished work (hence the name).  I plan
to write a few pages briefly summarizing what the undergraduate built.}

\solb{Survey the existing landscape and highlight that existing impure systems are
cooperative and make the developer of each function responsible for (constantly)
ensuring that it does not exceed its timeout.}

\solb{Note that this is because, like OSes, languages have failed to solve the thread
cancellation problem.  Use deprecation examples from the Julia Evans blog post.}
