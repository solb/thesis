\section{Conclusion}

We have presented the lightweight preemptible function, a new abstraction for
invoking a function with a timeout; discussed the design of \textit{libinger}, a
working implementation thereof; and demonstrated its composability by using it to
build a first-in-class preemptive userland thread library.  We find that lightweight
preemptible functions exhibit modest overheads but enable new functionality, and that
they are performant at mitigating head-of-line blocking and certain DoS attacks.
