\section{Conclusion}

We presented the lightweight preemptible function, a composable new abstraction
for invoking a function with a timeout.  The implementation, \textit{libinger},
serves as the foundation of
a first-in-class preemptive userland thread library.  Our evaluation shows that
lightweight
preemptible functions have overheads of a few percent (lower than similar OS
primitives), yet enable new functionality.
