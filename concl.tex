\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:concl}

In order to permit applications to \textit{fully leverage the 10s of $\mu{}s$
latencies available from the latest datacenter networks}, we propose a novel design
for serverless platforms that runs user-submitted microservices within shared
processes.  This structure is possible because of
\textit{compile-time memory safety guarantees} and \textit{microsecond-scale
preemption}.  We believe that these
two building blocks will enable new FaaS platforms that can deliver single-digit
invocation latency for lightweight, short-lived tasks.
