\section{Conclusion}

We have presented the lightweight preemptible function, a composable new abstraction
for invoking a function with a timeout.  Our implementation, \textit{libinger},
serves as the foundation of
a first-in-class preemptive userland thread library.  Our evaluation shows that
lightweight
preemptible functions have lower overheads than the most similar OS primitives, yet
enable new functionality.
