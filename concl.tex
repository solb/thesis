\section{Conclusion}

We have presented the lightweight preemptible function, a new abstraction for
invoking a function with a timeout; discussed the design of \textit{libinger}, a
working implementation thereof; and demonstrated its composability by using it to
build a first-in-class preemptive userland thread library.  We find that lightweight
preemptible functions exhibit lower overheads than the most similar OS primitives, but
enable new functionality.
