\subsection{Execution stacks}

When a preemptible function times out, \textit{libinger} returns a
continuation object.  The caller might pass this object around the program, which
could later \texttt{resume()} from a different stack frame.  To handle this case, the
\texttt{launch()} function switches to a new, dedicated stack just
before invoking the user-provided function.  This stack is then stored in the
continuation alongside the register context.

Because of the infeasibility of moving these stacks after a function has started
executing, \textit{libinger} currently heap-allocates large 2-MB stacks so it can
treat them as having fixed size.  To avoid an order of magnitude slowdown from having
such large dynamic allocations on the critical path, \textit{libinger} preallocates a
pool of reusable stacks when it is first used.
