Instead of being linked to their symbol definitions at load
time, some function calls resolve lazily the first time they are called:\@ their GOT
entries initially point to a special lookup function in the dynamic linker that
rewrites the GOT entry when invoked.  Such memoization would remove our intermediary,
so we alter the ELF relocation entries of affected symbols to trick the dynamic
linker into updating our shadow GOT instead.
