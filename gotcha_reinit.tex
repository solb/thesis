However, if a preemptible function
is canceled rather than being allowed to return, \textit{libinger} must
assume that its libset's shared state could be corrupted.  It unloads and reloads
all objects in such a libset by calling \texttt{libset\_reinit()}.

\thesis{Can we (re)initialize libsets more efficiently than that (e.g., by
restoring only their writable sections)?}
