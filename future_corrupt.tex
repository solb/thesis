% This being preliminary work, there remain security problems in need of addressing.
% While a couple of them represent unresolved limitations in our implementation, most
% of these are simply defense in depth to ensure that an unexpected failure (e.g., due

\paragraph{Nonreentrancy.}
Our use of Rust panics to unwind the stack during preemption can
corrupt the internal state of non-reentrant functions (e.g., Rust's dynamic
allocator).  Possible fixes include \blacklist{ing} these functions and delaying
preemption until they are finished or replacing the problematic function with a
safe one (e.g., a custom memory allocator).
%allocator with a custom one that manages a separate heap for each microservice.  The
%latter approach would also open the possibility of one-shot memory deallocation by
%simply ``deallocating'' an entire heap.
