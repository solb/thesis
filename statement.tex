We introduce novel programming abstractions for isolation of both time and memory.
They operate at finer granularity than traditional primitives, supporting preemption
at sub-millisecond timescales and tasks defined at the level of a function call.
This resolution enables new functionality for application programmers, including
users of unmanaged systems programming languages, all without requiring changes to
the existing systems stack.  Despite being concurrency abstractions, they employ
synchronous invocation to allow application programmers to make their own scheduling
decisions.  However, we find that they compose naturally with existing concurrency
abstractions centered around asynchronous background work, such as threads and
futures.  We demonstrate how such composition can enable asynchronous cancellation of
threads and the implementation of preemptive thread libraries in userland, both
regarded for decades as challenging problems.
