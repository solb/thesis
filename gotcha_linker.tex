While \textit{libinger} in principle runs on top of an unmodified
\texttt{ld-linux.so}, in
practice initializing more than one namespace tends to exhaust the
statically-allocated thread-local storage area.  As a workaround, we build
glibc with an increased \texttt{TLS\_STATIC\_SURPLUS}.  It is useful to also raise
the maximum number of namespaces by increasing \texttt{DL\_NNS}.

library header rewriting trick I use to circumvent the issue.}
