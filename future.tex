\section{Future work}
\label{sec:future}

As noted above, our exploration is preliminary; this section outlines several
open questions.  These questions fall into two categories:\@
\ifdefined\mk
shortcomings in our current implementation
\else
simplifications we made for benchmarking
\fi
and defense-in-depth safeguards against unexpected
failures (e.g., compiler bug or the operator allowing use of a buggy or malicious library).
