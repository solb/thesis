\section{Design}
\label{sec:design}

Some of this stuff can come (with canges) from the portions of the intro that people criticized for getting too deep into design decisions.

\begin{itemize}
\item As just demonstrated, can improve cold start latencies by two orders of magnitude and warm start by one by coalescing microservices together into worker processes
\item Use type safety as our first isolation line of defense
\begin{itemize}
\item Can combine with established techniques: separate users, \texttt{seccomp()}, ...
\end{itemize}
\item But also need to prevent them from hogging the CPU
\begin{itemize}
\item Can only be guaranteed with preemption of some sort.
\begin{itemize}
\item Were surprised to find that we could reliably get \texttt{SIGALRM}s as frequently as every 3--4 us (GRAPH)
\end{itemize}
\item Why Rust? (Lift argument from Introduction, but add in mention of GC)
\item All experiments run on machine w/... hardware specs, Linux and Rust versions
\end{itemize}

\solb{Want another system design here (elaborated version of last part of \ref{fig:invocationdesigns})?}

\end{itemize}
