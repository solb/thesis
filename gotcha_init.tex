\subsection{Managing libsets}
\label{sec:gotchainit}

At program start, \textit{libgotcha} initializes a pool of libsets, each with a full
complement of the program's loaded object files.  Throughout the program's run
\textit{libinger} tracks the libset assigned to each preemptible function that has
started running but not yet reached successful completion.  When a preemptible
function completes, \textit{libinger} assumes it has not corrupted its libset and
returns it to the pool of available ones.
